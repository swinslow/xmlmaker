			This license governs use of the accompanying software. If you use the software, you accept this license. If you do not accept the license, do not use the software.
			</p>
			<p>
			1. Definitions
			</p>
			<p>
			The terms "reproduce," "reproduction," "derivative works," and "distribution"
			have the same meaning here as under U.S. copyright law.
			</p>
			<p>
			A "contribution" is the original software, or any additions or changes to the
			software.
			</p>
			<p>
			A "contributor" is any person that distributes its contribution under this
			license.
			</p>
			<p>
			"Licensed patents" are a contributor’s patent claims that read directly on its contribution.
			</p>
			<p>
			2. Grant of Rights
			</p>
			<p>
			(A) Copyright Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license
			conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-
			exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce its
			contribution, prepare derivative works of its contribution, and distribute its
			contribution or any derivative works that you create.
			</p>
			<p>
			(B) Patent Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license
			conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-
			exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under its licensed patents to make,

			contribution in the software or derivative works of the contribution in the
			software.
			</p>
			<p>
			3. Conditions and Limitations
			</p>
			<p>

			contributors’ name, logo, or trademarks.
			</p>
			<p>
			(B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that you
			claim are infringed by the software, your patent license from such contributor
			to the software ends automatically.
			</p>
			<p>
			(C) If you distribute any portion of the software, you must retain all
			copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are present in the
			software.
			</p>
			<p>
			(D) If you distribute any portion of the software in source code form, you may
			do so only under this license by including a complete copy of this license with
			your distribution. If you distribute any portion of the software in compiled or
			object code form, you may only do so under a license that complies with this
			license.
			</p>
			<p>
			(E) The software is licensed "as-is." You bear the risk of using it. The
			contributors give no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may have
			additional consumer rights under your local laws which this license cannot
			change. To the extent permitted under your local laws, the contributors exclude
			the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and
			non-infringement.
			</p>
			<p>
			(F) Platform Limitation- The licenses granted in sections 2(A) & 2(B) extend
