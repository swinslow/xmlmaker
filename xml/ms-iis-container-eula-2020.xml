			MICROSOFT SOFTWARE SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE TERMS
			CONTAINER OS IMAGE
			</p>
			<p>
			Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates)
			(referenced as "us," "we," or "Microsoft") licenses this Container OS Image
			supplement to you ("Supplement"). You are licensed to use this Supplement in
			conjunction with the underlying host operating system software ("Host Software")
			solely to assist running the containers feature in the Host Software.  The Host
			Software license terms apply to your use of the Supplement. You may not use it
			if you do not have a license for the Host Software. You may use this Supplement
			with each validly licensed copy of the Host Software.
			</p>
			<p>
			ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS
			</p>
			<p>
			Your use of the Supplement as specified in the preceding paragraph may result in
			the creation or modification of a container image ("Container Image") that
			includes certain Supplement components. For clarity, a Container Image is
			separate and distinct from a virtual machine or virtual appliance image.
			Pursuant to these license terms, we grant you a restricted right to redistribute
			such Supplement components under the following conditions:
			</p>
			<p>
			 	(i) you may use the Supplement components only as used in, and as a part of
			 	your Container Image,
			</p>
			<p>
				(ii) you may use such Supplement components in your Container Image as long
				as you have significant primary functionality in your Container Image that
				is materially separate and distinct from the Supplement; and
			</p>
			<p>
				(iii) you agree to include these license terms (or similar terms required by
				us or a hoster) with your Container Image to properly license the possible
				use of the Supplement components by your end-users.
			</p>
			<p>
			We reserve all other rights not expressly granted herein.
			</p>
			<p>
			By using this Supplement, you accept these terms. If you do not accept them, do
			not use this Supplement.
