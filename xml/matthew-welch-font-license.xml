			All my fonts are free. You can use them for most personal or business uses you'd like, and I ask for no money. I would, however, like to hear from you. If you use my fonts for something please send me a postcard or e-mail letting me know how you used them. Send me a copy if you can or let me know where I can find your work.
			</p>
			<p>
			You may use these fonts for graphical or printed work, but you may not sell them or include them in a collection of fonts (on CD or otherwise) being sold. You can redistribute these fonts as long as you charge nothing to receive them.
			</p>
			<p>
			If you use any of these fonts for commercial purposes please credit me in at least some little way.
