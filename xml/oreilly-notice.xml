			Our books are here to help you get your job done. In general, you may use the
			code in our books in your programs and documentation. You do not need to contact
			us for permission unless you're reproducing a significant portion of the code.
			For example, writing a program that uses several chunks of code from our books
			does not require permission. Answering a question by citing our books and
			quoting example code does not require permission. On the other hand, selling or
			distributing a CD-ROM of examples from O'Reilly books does require permission.
			Incorporating a significant amount of example code from our books into your
			product's documentation does require permission.

			We appreciate, but do not require, attribution. An attribution usually includes
			the title, author, publisher, and ISBN.

			<p>
			If you think your use of code examples falls outside fair use or the permission
			given here, feel free to contact us at permissions@oreilly.com.
