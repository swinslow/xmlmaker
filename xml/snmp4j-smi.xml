			SNMP4J-SMI LICENSE AGREEMENT
			============================
			</p>
			<p>
			THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is  made effective as of the date  the
			product is  installed by and between (i) Frank Fock,  the  author  of SNMP4J-SMI
			("LICENSOR") and the party executing this Agreement as Licensee ("LICENSEE").
			</p>
			<p>
			
			1. DEFINITIONS.
			</p>
			<p>
			1.1  The  term   "Software Product"  means   Frank  Fock's  SNMP4J-SMI  computer
			software (including  Source Code,  derived Object  Code, and  derived Executable
			Code  as defined  in Section 1.3,  1.4, and 1.5)  and documentation thereof,  as
			specified in Exhibit A,  that is  provided by  LICENSOR to  LICENSEE  hereunder,
			including bug fixes and updates   thereto provided by  LICENSOR to  LICENSEE  in
			connection with this Agreement. The  term "derived" in the above  context refers
			to the process  of creating machine  executable  code from   the original Source
			Code only.   It  does  not refer   to amendment  or alteration   of the original
			Source Code by LICENSOR or any third party.
			</p>
			<p>
			1.2  The  term "Intellectual  Property  Rights" means  patent  rights, copyright
			rights, trade secret rights, and any other intellectual property rights.
			</p>
			<p>
			1.3 The  term "Executable  Code" is  a fully  compiled and  linked program  that
			contains any code derived from the Software Product. It can no longer be altered
			or combined with any  other code. Executable code  is ready to be  executed by a
			computer and  is essentially  a complete  software image  for use  in a specific
			product.
			</p>
			<p>
			1.4 The term "Object Code" is the compiled version of the Software Product  that
			can be linked and therefore combined with other code to create  Executable  Code
			as specified in Exhibit A. Examples of Object Code  are libraries  and  software
			development kits, in particular SNMP development kits.
			</p>
			<p>
			1.5 The term "Source Code" is  the human readable form of the  Software Product,
			as specified in Exhibit A.
			</p>
			<p>
			1.6  Documentation  means  the  documentation  regarding  the  Licensed Software
			provided by LICENSOR to LICENSEE hereunder.
			</p>
			<p>
			
			2. GRANT OF LICENSE.

			<p>
			2.1 Source and Object Code User License. Subject to the terms and  conditions of

			termination rights  in Section  6), non-exclusive,  non-transferable license  to
			reproduce, and use the Object Code for LICENSEE's personal use only.
			</p>
			<p>
			2.2 Except as  specified in 2.1,  neither the Software  Product Source Code  nor
			Object Code derived  from the Software  Product may be  redistributed or resold.

			and  resold  without limitation  and   without royalty,  provided  that LICENSEE
