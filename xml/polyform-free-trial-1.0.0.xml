			</p>
			<p>
			## Acceptance
			</p>
			<p>

			to them as both strict obligations and conditions to all
			your licenses.
			</p>
			<p>
			## Copyright License
			</p>
			<p>
			The licensor grants you a copyright license for the software
			to do everything you might do with the software that would
			otherwise infringe the licensor's copyright in it for any
			permitted purpose.  However, you may only make changes or
			new works based on the software according to [Changes and New
			Works License](#changes-and-new-works-license), and you may
			not distribute copies of the software.
			</p>
			<p>
			## Changes and New Works License
			</p>
			<p>
			The licensor grants you an additional copyright license to
			make changes and new works based on the software for any
			permitted purpose.
			</p>
			<p>
			## Patent License
			</p>
			<p>
			The licensor grants you a patent license for the software that
			covers patent claims the licensor can license, or becomes able
			to license, that you would infringe by using the software.
			</p>
			<p>
			## Fair Use
			</p>
			<p>
			You may have "fair use" rights for the software under the
			law. These terms do not limit them.
			</p>
			<p>
			## Free Trial
			</p>
			<p>
			Use to evaluate whether the software suits a particular
			application for less than 32 consecutive calendar days, on
			behalf of you or your company, is use for a permitted purpose.
			</p>
			<p>
			## No Other Rights
			</p>
			<p>
			These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of
			your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from
			granting licenses to anyone else.  These terms do not imply
			any other licenses.
			</p>
			<p>
			## Patent Defense
			</p>
			<p>
			If you make any written claim that the software infringes or
			contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license
			for the software granted under these terms ends immediately. If
			your company makes such a claim, your patent license ends
			immediately for work on behalf of your company.
			</p>
			<p>
			## Violations
			</p>
			<p>
			If you violate any of these terms, or do anything with the
			software not covered by your licenses, all your licenses
			end immediately.
			</p>
			<p>
			## No Liability
			</p>
			<p>
			***As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without
			any warranty or condition, and the licensor will not be liable
			to you for any damages arising out of these terms or the use
			or nature of the software, under any kind of legal claim.***
