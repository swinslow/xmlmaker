			The Questions
			</p>
			<p>
			Due to an inordinate amount of email I receive regarding development specific questions, I find it sometimes difficult to respond. If you don't hear from me, I recommend searching either Microsoft's MSDN Library Online, Microsoft's Online Support Knowledge Base, or Deja News newsgroup archives for answers to your Visual Basic related questions.
			</p>
			<p>
			You may find me frequenting some of the "vb" newsgroups on the Microsoft news server msnews.microsoft.com, and on occasion, the "vb" newsgroups on the news server news.devx.com.
