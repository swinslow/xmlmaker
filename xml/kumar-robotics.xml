			This code is 100% free.  Use it anywhere you
			want.  Rewrite it, restructure it, whatever.  If you can write software
			that makes money off of it, good for you.  I kinda like capitalism.
			Please don't blame me if it causes your $30 billion dollar satellite
			explode in orbit.  If you redistribute it in any form, I'd appreciate it
			if you would leave this notice here.
