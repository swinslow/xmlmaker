			COPYING CONDITIONS FOR TeX Live:
			</p>
			<p>
			To the best of our knowledge, all software in the TeX Live distribution
			is freely redistributable (libre, that is, not necessarily gratis),
			within the Free Software Foundation's definition and the Debian Free
			Software Guidelines.  Where the two conflict, we generally follow the
			FSF (see [*] below).  If you find any non-free files included, please
			contact us (references given at the end).
			</p>
			<p>
			That said, TeX Live has neither a single copyright holder nor a single
			license covering its entire contents, since it is a collection of many
			disparate packages.  Therefore, you may copy, modify, and/or
			redistribute software from TeX Live only if you comply with the
			requirements placed thereon by the owners of the respective packages.
			</p>
			<p>
			To most easily learn these requirements, we suggest checking the TeX
			Catalogue at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/ (or any
			CTAN mirror).  The Catalogue is also included in TeX Live in
			./texmf/doc/html/catalogue/, but the online version will have updates.
			Of course the legal statements within the packages themselves are the
			final authority.
			</p>
			<p>
			In some cases, TeX Live is distributed with a snapshot of the CTAN
			archive, which is entirely independent of and separable from TeX Live
			itself.  (The "live" DVD in the TeX Collection is one example of this.)
			Please be aware that the CTAN snapshot contains many files which are
			*not* freely redistributable; see LICENSE.CTAN for more information.
			</p>
			<p>
			
			GUIDELINES FOR REDISTRIBUTION:
			</p>
			<p>
			In general, you may redistribute TeX Live, with or without modification,
			for profit or not, according to the usual free software tenets.  Here
			are some general guidelines for doing this:
			</p>
			<p>
			- If you make any changes to the TeX Live distribution or any
			package it contains, besides complying with any licensing requirements,
			you must prominently mention such changes in your modified distribution
			so that users do not take your work for ours, and know to contact you,
			not us, in case of questions or problems.  A new top-level
			README.<yourwork> file is a good place to describe the general situation.
			</p>
			<p>
			- Especially (but not necessarily) if changes or additions are made, we
			recommend a clearly different title, such as "<your work> DVD, based on
			TeX Live YYYY (with updates)", where YYYY is the year of TeX Live you
			are using.  This credits both our work and yours.
			</p>
			<p>
			- You absolutely may *not* place your own copyright on the entire
			distribution, since it is not your work (as stated above, TeX Live is
			not created by any single person or entity).  Statements such as "all
			rights reserved" and "may not be reproduced" are especially
			reprehensible, since they are antithetical to the free software
			principles under which TeX Live is produced.
			</p>
			<p>
			- You may use any cover or media label designs that you wish.  Such
			packaging and marketing details are not covered by any TeX Live license.
			</p>
			<p>
			- Finally, we make the following requests (not legal requirements):
			</p>
			<p>
			a) Acknowledging that TeX Live is developed as a joint effort by all TeX
			   user groups, and encouraging the user/reader to join their user group
			   of choice.  The web page http://www.tug.org/usergroups.html may be
			   referenced as a list of TeX user groups.
			</p>
			<p>
			b) Referencing the TeX Live home page: http://www.tug.org/texlive/
			</p>
			<p>
			Such information may be placed on the label of your media, your cover,
			and/or in accompanying text (for instance, in the acknowledgements
			section of a book).
			</p>
			<p>
			Finally, although it is again not at all a requirement, we'd like to
			invite any redistributors to make a donation to the project, whether
			cash or in-kind, for example via https://www.tug.org/donate/dev.html.
			Thanks.
			</p>
			<p>
			
			If you have any questions or comments, *please* contact us.  In general,
			we appreciate being given the chance to review any TeX Live-related
			material in advance of publication, simply to avoid mistakes.  It is
			much better to correct text on a CD label or in a book before thousands
			of copies are made!
			</p>
			<p>
			We are also happy to keep anyone planning a publication informed as to
			our deadlines and progress.  Just let us know.  However, be aware that
			TeX Live is produced entirely by volunteers, and no dates can be
			guaranteed.
			</p>
			<p>
			
			LICENSING FOR NEW PACKAGES:
			</p>
			<p>
			Finally, we are often asked what license to use for new work.  To be
			considered for inclusion on TeX Live, a package must use a free software
			license, such as the LaTeX Project Public License, the GNU General
			Public License, the X Window System license, the modified BSD license,
			etc.  Furthermore, all sources must be available, including for
			documentation files.  Please see the url's below for more information.
			</p>
			<p>
			Thanks for your interest in TeX.
			</p>
			<p>
			- Karl Berry, editor, for the TeX Live team

			[*] Conflicts between FSF and Debian.
			</p>
			<p>
			The most notable instance of legal conflict between the FSF definition
			of "free software" and the Debian Free Software Guidelines is in regard
			to the GNU Free Documentation License when "invariant sections" (e.g.,
			Front-Cover Texts, Back-Cover Texts, or Invariant Sections) are
			included.  (FSF considers it free, of course, and Debian doesn't.) 
			</p>
			<p>
			The most common instance of such a license is in documentation for
			official GNU packages -- such as GNU Texinfo, which is included in TeX
			Live.  There may be other GFDL'd files with invariant sections as well;
			we have not exhaustively checked.
			</p>
			<p>
			For TeX Live, we decided to follow the FSF, rather than Debian.  So such
			documentation *is* included in the original TeX Live distribution.  (In
			repackagings of TL according to Debian rules, it is removed.)  We surely
			wish these two major organizations in the free software world could
			cooperate on a documentation license acceptable to both.
			</p>
			<p>
			If other specific conflicts are brought to our attention, we will note
			them here.
