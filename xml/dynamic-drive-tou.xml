			***********************************************/
			</p>
			<p>
			Sometimes you may wish to move the DHTML script to an external .js file. In such
			instances, the credit notice must still be retained within the SCRIPT tags, in
			the page's visible source:
			</p>
			<p>
			<script src="countdown.js" type="text/javascript">
			/*********************************************** 
			* Dynamic Countdown script- © Dynamic Drive (http://www.dynamicdrive.com)
