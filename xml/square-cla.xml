			Square Inc. Individual Contributor License Agreement
			</p>
			<p>
			An Individual Contributor License Agreement (an "Agreement") is required to establish and define the intellectual property license granted in connection with Contributions (defined below) from any person or entity to Square, Inc. (“Square”) for inclusion in any of the products owned or managed by Square (the “Work”). This Agreement is for your protection as well as Square’s. This Agreement does not alter your rights to use your own Contributions for other purposes. By executing this Agreement, you accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for any past, current, or future Contributions submitted to Square. Except for the license granted herein to Square and recipients of software distributed by Square, you reserve all right, title, and interest in and to the Contributions you create.

			“Control:” shall mean (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of an entity, whether by contract or otherwise; or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares; or (iii) beneficial ownership of an entity.
			</p>
			<p>
			"Contribution:" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally Transmitted by You to Square for inclusion in the Work. 
			</p>
			<p>
			"Transmitted:" shall mean any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Square or its representatives for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communications that are conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."
			</p>
			<p>
			"You:" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with Square. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single contributor.
			</p>
			<p>
			2. Grant of Copyright License.
			</p>
			<p>
			Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Square and to recipients of software distributed by Square a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
