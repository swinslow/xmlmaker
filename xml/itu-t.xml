ITU takes no position concerning the evidence, validity or applicability of claimed Intellectual Property Rights, whether asserted by ITU members or others outside of the Recommendation development process. However, implementors are strongly urged to consult the TSB patent database (http://www.itu.int/ipr) to discover if ITU has received notice of intellectual property, protected by patents, which may be required to implement a Recommendation.
