			</p>
			<p>
			Sun is licensing the Technology under this Java Research License (the
			"License") to promote research, education, innovation, and development
			using the Technology.  This License is not intended to permit or
			enable access to the Technology for active consultation as part of
			creating an independent implementation of the Technology.
			</p>
			<p>
			COMMERCIAL USE AND DISTRIBUTION OF TECHNOLOGY AND MODIFICATIONS IS
			PERMITTED ONLY UNDER A SUN COMMERCIAL LICENSE.
			</p>
			<p>
			III.  RESEARCH USE RIGHTS.
			</p>
			<p>
			A.  License Grant. Subject to the conditions contained herein, Sun
			grants to You a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, and
			royalty-free license to do the following for Your Research Use only:
			</p>
			<p>
			1.  Reproduce, create Modifications of,  and use the Technology
			alone, or with Modifications;

			Modifications, with other Licensees; and
			</p>
			<p>

			Modifications, to any third parties for Research Use only, under a
			license of Your choice that is consistent with this License; and
			publish papers and books discussing the Technology which may include
			relevant excerpts that do not in the aggregate constitute a
			significant portion of the Technology.
			</p>
			<p>
			B.  Residual Rights.  If You examine the Technology after accepting
			this License and remember anything about it later, You are not
			"tainted" in a way that would prevent You from creating or
			contributing to an independent implementation, but this License grants
			You no rights to Sun's copyrights or patents for use in such an
			implementation.
			</p>
			<p>
			C.  No Implied Licenses.  Other than the rights granted herein, Sun
			retains all rights, title, and interest in Technology, and You retain
			all rights, title, and interest in Your Modifications and associated
			specifications, subject to the terms of this License.
			</p>
			<p>
			D.  Third Party Software.  Portions of the Technology may be
			provided with licenses or other notices from third parties that govern
			the use of those portions. Any licenses granted hereunder do not alter
			any rights and obligations You may have under such licenses, however,
			the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provisions in
			this License will apply to all Technology in this distribution.
