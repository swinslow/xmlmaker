			<p>
			As a special exception to the following license, the Xenomai
			project gives permission for additional uses of the header files
			contained in this directory.
			</p>
			<p>
			The exception is that, if you include these header files unmodified to
			produce application programs executing in user-space that use
			Xenomai services by normal Xenomai system calls, this does not
			by itself cause the resulting executable to be covered by the GNU
			General Public License. This is merely considered normal use of the
			Xenomai system, and does not fall under the heading of "derived
			work".
			</p>
			<p>
			This exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why the
			executable file might be covered by the GNU General Public License. In
			any case, this exception never applies when the application code is
			built as a static or dynamically loadable portion of the Linux kernel.
			</p>
			<p>
			This exception applies only to the code released by the Xenomai
			project under the name Xenomai and bearing this exception notice.
			If you copy code from other sources into a copy of Xenomai, the
			exception does not apply to the code that you add in this way.
			</p>
