			Additional Grant of Patent Rights Version 2
			</p>
			<p>
			"Software" means the <fastText> software distributed by Facebook, Inc.
			</p>
			<p>
			Facebook, Inc. ("Facebook") hereby grants to each recipient of the Software
			("you") a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable
			(subject to the termination provision below) license under any Necessary
			Claims, to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise
			transfer the Software. For avoidance of doubt, no license is granted under
			Facebookâ€™s rights in any patent claims that are infringed by (i) modifications
			to the Software made by you or any third party or (ii) the Software in
			combination with any software or other technology.
			</p>
			<p>
			The license granted hereunder will terminate, automatically and without notice,
			if you (or any of your subsidiaries, corporate affiliates or agents) initiate
			directly or indirectly, or take a direct financial interest in, any Patent
			Assertion: (i) against Facebook or any of its subsidiaries or corporate
			affiliates, (ii) against any party if such Patent Assertion arises in whole or
			in part from any software, technology, product or service of Facebook or any of
			its subsidiaries or corporate affiliates, or (iii) against any party relating
			to the Software. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Facebook or any of its
			subsidiaries or corporate affiliates files a lawsuit alleging patent
			infringement against you in the first instance, and you respond by filing a
			patent infringement counterclaim in that lawsuit against that party that is
			unrelated to the Software, the license granted hereunder will not terminate
			under section (i) of this paragraph due to such counterclaim.
			</p>
			<p>
			A "Necessary Claim" is a claim of a patent owned by Facebook that is
			necessarily infringed by the Software standing alone.
			</p>
			<p>
			A "Patent Assertion" is any lawsuit or other action alleging direct, indirect,
			or contributory infringement or inducement to infringe any patent, including a
			cross-claim or counterclaim.
