			# Code Credit License
			</p>
			<p>
			Version 1.0.1
			</p>
			<p>
			## Purpose
			</p>
			<p>
			This license gives everyone as much permission to work with
			this software as possible, while protecting contributors
			from liability and requiring credit for their work.
			</p>
			<p>
			## Agreement
			</p>
			<p>
			In order to receive this license, you have to agree
			to its rules.  Those rules are both obligations under
			that agreement and conditions to your license.  Don't do
			anything with this software that triggers a rule you can't
			or won't follow.
			</p>
			<p>
			## Notices
			</p>
			<p>
			Make sure everyone who gets a copy of any part of
			this software from you, with or without changes,
			also gets the text of this license or a link to
			<https://codecreditlicense.com/license/1.0.1>.
			</p>
			<p>
			## Give Credit
			</p>
			<p>
			You must give this software and each contributor credit
			for contributing to goods or services that you develop,
			test, produce, or provide with the help of this software.
			</p>
			<p>
			## How to Give Credit
			</p>
			<p>
			In general, you must give credit in such a way that others
			can freely and readily find a written notice identifying
			this software, by name, as a contribution to your goods
			or services, as well as each contributor, by name, as a
			contributor to this software.  You must not do anything
			to stop others from sharing, publishing, or using those
			credits.
			</p>
			<p>
			## Conventions
			</p>
			<p>
			If widespread convention dictates a particular way to
			give credit for your kind of goods or services, such as
			by end credit for a film, citation for an academic paper,
			acknowledgment for a book, or billing for a show, then
			follow that convention.  For software provided to users to
			run on their own computers, give credit in documentation,
			notice files, and any "about" page or screen.  For software
			provided as a web service, give credit in `credits.txt`
			according to <https://creditstxt.com>.
			</p>
			<p>
			## Who to Credit
			</p>
			<p>
			If contributors give their names or the name of this
			software along with the software in a conventional way,
			such as in software package metadata or on an "about"
			page or screen, you may rely on the names they give that
			way to be accurate and complete.  If contributors don't
			give names that way, but include a link to a homepage
			for this software, you must investigate that homepage for
			names to credit.  If contributors give neither names to
			credit nor a link to a homepage, you do not have to do
			independent research to find names to credit.
			</p>
			<p>
			## Declining Credit
			</p>
			<p>
			On written request from a contributor, you must remove
			their name from the credits for your goods or services
			going forward.  On written request from all credited
			contributors to this software, you must do the same for
			the name of this software.
			</p>
			<p>
			## Copyright
			</p>
			<p>
			Each contributor licenses you to do everything with this
			software that would otherwise infringe that contributor's
			copyright in it.
			</p>
			<p>
			## Patent
			</p>
			<p>
			Each contributor licenses you to do everything with this
			software that would otherwise infringe any patent claims
			they can license or become able to license.
			</p>
			<p>
			## Excuse
			</p>
			<p>
			If anyone notifies you in writing that you have
			not complied with [Notices](#notices) or [Give
			Credit](#give-credit), you can keep your license by
			taking all practical steps to comply within thirty days
			after the notice.  If you do not do so, your license
			ends immediately.
			</p>
			<p>
			## Reliability
			</p>
			<p>
			No contributor can revoke this license.
			</p>
			<p>
			## No Liability
			</p>
			<p>
			***As far as the law allows, this software comes as is,
			without any warranty or condition, and no contributor
			will be liable to anyone for any damages related to this
			software or this license, under any kind of legal claim.***
