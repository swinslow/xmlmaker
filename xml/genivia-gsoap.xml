			Licensing Options
			</p>
			<p>
			There are three licensing options.
			</p>
			<p>
			Standard Open Source Edition: The open source edition offers basic functionality
			without the use of the wsdl2h tool (no WSDL/schemas to code generation), no
			webserver, no UDDI support, and no sample applications to use as basis for your
			projects. The limited edition is licensed under the gSOAP public license free of
			charge for commercial use. The gSOAP public license requires a notice (Exhibit
			B) in the project documentation and in the third-party license list of the
			product.
			</p>
			<p>
			Standard Commercial Edition: The standard edition of the gSOAP toolset for
			commercial use. This edition is identical to the standard open source edition,
			but allows the use of the wsdl2h and soapcpp2 tools for commercial code and
			document generation. This licens does not have the limitations of the open-
			source GPL and gSOAP public licenses. The standard commercial edition is
			licensed with limited warranties.
			</p>
			<p>
			Enterprise Edition: The enterprise edition of the gSOAP toolset provides the
			gold standard toolset for your enterprise. The enterprise edition is best suited
			for organizations that require high reliability, security, and extensive support
			for WSDL, SOAP, XML, and WS-* protocols. Warranties, software maintenance and
			support are included.
			</p>
