			jQuery Public Domain License
			</p>
			<p>
			NO COPYRIGHTS OR LICENSES. DO WHAT YOU LIKE.  This is the new jQuery Tools license. Copyrights and patents are evil. They block the natural progress of development. We all know it: if people start sharing instead of owning the world would be a better place. Today money is king. This results in closed systems and poor quality and in many cases people are even seriously exploited. For businessmen nothing is enough.
