			JGRAPH GENERAL LICENSE STATEMENT AND LIMITED WARRANTY
			IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY
			</p>
			<p>
			This license statement and limited warranty constitutes a legal agreement 
			("License Agreement") between you (either as an individual or a single entity) 
			and JGraph Ltd. for the software product ("Software") identified above, 
			including any software, media, and accompanying on-line or printed 
			documentation.
			</p>
			<p>
			BY INSTALLING, COPYING, OR OTHERWISE USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND 
			BY ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE LICENSE AGREEMENT.
			</p>
			<p>
			Upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the License Agreement, 
			JGraph Ltd. grants you the right to use the Software in the manner provided 
			below.
			</p>
			<p>
			This Software is owned by JGraph Ltd. and is protected by copyright law and 
			international copyright treaty. Therefore, you must treat this Software like 
			any other copyrighted material (e.g., a book), except that you may either make 
			one copy of the Software solely for backup or archival purposes or transfer the 
			Software to a single hard disk provided you keep the original solely for backup 
			or archival purposes.
			</p>
			<p>
			You may transfer the Software and documentation on a permanent basis provided 
			you retain no copies and the recipient agrees to the terms of the License 
			Agreement. Except as provided in the License Agreement, you may not transfer, 
			rent, lease, lend, copy, modify, translate, sublicense, time-share or 
			electronically transmit or receive the Software, media or documentation.
			</p>

			license purchased. A Single Developer License may be installed on a computer 
			and be freely moved from one computer to another, providing that you have 
			purchased a number of Single Developer Licenses equivalent to the maximum 
			possible number of developers using that Software concurrently. A Site 
			Developer License may be installed on any number of computers and be used by 
			any number of developers at any time at one geographical location. A 
			geographical location is defined as a building or site occupied by the 
			employees of one company or organization.
			If you are an entity, JGraph Ltd. grants you the right to designate 
			one individual within your organization ("Named User") to have the right to use 
			the Software in the manner provided above, in the case of the Single Developer 
			License.

			accompanying Software libraries without additional license or fees, subject to 
			all of the conditions in this License Agreement.

			<p>
			ADDITIONAL REDISTRIBUTION TERMS FOR SOFTWARE

			ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT 
			APPLY TO YOU.
			</p>

			control, direct life support machines, or weapons systems, in which the failure 
			of the Software could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe 
			physical or environmental damage ("High Risk Activities"). JGraph Ltd. and
			its suppliers specifically disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness 
			for High Risk Activities.
			</p>
			<p>

			unenforceable, the remainder will remain valid and enforceable according to its
			terms. If any remedy provided is determined to have failed for its essential
			purpose, all limitations of liability and exclusions of damages set forth in 
			the Limited Warranty shall remain in effect.
