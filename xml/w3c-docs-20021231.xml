			Notes
			This version: http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-documents-20021231
			</p>
			<p>
			This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31 2002.
			This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license can
			be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, moves information on
			style sheets, DTDs, and schemas to the Copyright FAQ, reflects that ERCIM is now
			a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated version of the
			license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". See the older formulation for
			the policy prior to this date. Please see our Copyright FAQ for common questions
			about using materials from our site, such as the translating or annotating
			specifications.
