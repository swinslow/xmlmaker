			More precisely: you can use Sglib or its derivative forms (under the condition
			that the Copyright notice is preserved) in any project, whether commercial or
			not, free of charges. In particular, you can use Sglib under the terms of any
			license defined as an open source license by the Open Source Initiative
			(see http://www.opensource.org/). This includes most common open source licenses
			such as the BSD license and GNU GPL.
