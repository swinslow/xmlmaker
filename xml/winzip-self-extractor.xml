			License requirements to distribute self-extracting Zip files
			</p>
			<p>
			If you are using a registered copy of WinZip Self-Extractor, you do not need any
			additional license in order to distribute the self-extracting Zip files you
			create. The license requirements for the software in the self-extracting Zip
			files you create, though, is your responsibility.
			</p>
			<p>
			In regards to usage, the WinZip Self-Extractor Registered License states:
			</p>
			<p>
			If you have purchased a single-user license you have the right to install and
			use a single copy of WinZip Self-Extractor on one computer or workstation. If
			you have purchased a multi-user license and received a valid registration file
			or code, you or your organization have the right to install a copy of WinZip
			Self-Extractor on multiple computers up to the number of "Licensed Copies" that
			you have acquired, as indicated in the documents issued by WinZip Computing when
			granting the License.
			</p>
			<p>
			Here is the section of the license that specifically addresses distribution of
			the self-extracting Zip files you create:
			</p>
			<p>
			WinZip Self-Extractor may be used to create an unlimited number of freely
			distributable, royalty-free self-extracting Zip files. Each self-extracting Zip
			file contains, among other things, a portion of WinZip Self-Extractor, including
			copyrighted software, proprietary notices, and identifying information (this
			portion is the "Extraction Software"). You may not alter or modify the
			Extraction Software, nor give anyone permission to do so.
			</p>
			<p>
			If you have additional questions about license requirements for self-extractors,
			please email the Service Department.
