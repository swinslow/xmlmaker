			# PolyForm Shield License 1.0.0
			</p>
			<p>
			<https://polyformproject.org/licenses/shield/1.0.0>
			</p>
			<p>
			## Acceptance
			</p>
			<p>
			In order to get any license under these terms, you must agree
			to them as both strict obligations and conditions to all
			your licenses.
			</p>
			<p>
			## Copyright License
			</p>
			<p>
			The licensor grants you a copyright license for the
			software to do everything you might do with the software
			that would otherwise infringe the licensor's copyright
			in it for any permitted purpose.  However, you may
			only distribute the software according to [Distribution
			License](#distribution-license) and make changes or new works
			based on the software according to [Changes and New Works
			License](#changes-and-new-works-license).
			</p>
			<p>
			## Distribution License
			</p>
			<p>
			The licensor grants you an additional copyright license
			to distribute copies of the software.  Your license
			to distribute covers distributing the software with
			changes and new works permitted by [Changes and New Works
			License](#changes-and-new-works-license).
			</p>
			<p>
			## Notices
			</p>
			<p>
			You must ensure that anyone who gets a copy of any part of
			the software from you also gets a copy of these terms or the
			URL for them above, as well as copies of any plain-text lines
			beginning with `Required Notice:` that the licensor provided
			with the software.  For example:
			</p>
			<p>
			> Required Notice: Copyright Yoyodyne, Inc. (http://example.com)
			</p>
			<p>
			## Changes and New Works License
			</p>
			<p>
			The licensor grants you an additional copyright license to
			make changes and new works based on the software for any
			permitted purpose.
			</p>
			<p>
			## Patent License
			</p>
			<p>
			The licensor grants you a patent license for the software that
			covers patent claims the licensor can license, or becomes able
			to license, that you would infringe by using the software.
			</p>
			<p>
			## Noncompete
			</p>
			<p>
			Any purpose is a permitted purpose, except for providing any
			product that competes with the software or any product the
			licensor or any of its affiliates provides using the software.
			</p>
			<p>
			## Competition
			</p>
			<p>
			Goods and services compete even when they provide functionality
			through different kinds of interfaces or for different technical
			platforms.  Applications can compete with services, libraries
			with plugins, frameworks with development tools, and so on,
			even if they're written in different programming languages
			or for different computer architectures.  Goods and services
			compete even when provided free of charge.  If you market a
			product as a practical substitute for the software or another
			product, it definitely competes.
			</p>
			<p>
			## New Products
			</p>
			<p>
			If you are using the software to provide a product that does
			not compete, but the licensor or any of its affiliates brings
			your product into competition by providing a new version of
			the software or another product using the software, you may
			continue using versions of the software available under these
			terms beforehand to provide your competing product, but not
			any later versions.
			</p>
			<p>
			## Discontinued Products
			</p>
			<p>
			You may begin using the software to compete with a product
			or service that the licensor or any of its affiliates has
			stopped providing, unless the licensor includes a plain-text
			line beginning with `Licensor Line of Business:` with the
			software that mentions that line of business.  For example:
			</p>
			<p>
			> Licensor Line of Business: YoyodyneCMS Content Management
			System (http://example.com/cms)
			</p>
			<p>
			## Sales of Business
			</p>
			<p>
			If the licensor or any of its affiliates sells a line of
			business developing the software or using the software
			to provide a product, the buyer can also enforce
			[Noncompete](#noncompete) for that product.
			</p>
			<p>
			## Fair Use
			</p>
			<p>
			You may have "fair use" rights for the software under the
			law. These terms do not limit them.
			</p>
			<p>
			## No Other Rights
			</p>
			<p>
			These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of
			your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from
			granting licenses to anyone else.  These terms do not imply
			any other licenses.
			</p>
			<p>
			## Patent Defense
			</p>
			<p>
			If you make any written claim that the software infringes or
			contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license
			for the software granted under these terms ends immediately. If
			your company makes such a claim, your patent license ends
			immediately for work on behalf of your company.
			</p>
			<p>
			## Violations
			</p>
			<p>
			The first time you are notified in writing that you have
			violated any of these terms, or done anything with the software
			not covered by your licenses, your licenses can nonetheless
			continue if you come into full compliance with these terms,
			and take practical steps to correct past violations, within
			32 days of receiving notice.  Otherwise, all your licenses
			end immediately.
			</p>
			<p>
			## No Liability
			</p>
			<p>
			***As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without
			any warranty or condition, and the licensor will not be liable
			to you for any damages arising out of these terms or the use
			or nature of the software, under any kind of legal claim.***
