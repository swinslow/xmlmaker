			German Free Software License
			</p>
			<p>
			(c) Ministry of Science and Research, State of 
			North-Rhine Westphalia 2004
			</p>
			<p>
			Developed and created by Axel Metzger and Till 
			Jaeger, Institut f√ºr Rechtsfragen der Freien und 
			Open Source Software (Institute for Legal Issues 
			On Free and Open Source Software), 
			<http://www.ifross.de>.
			</p>
			<p>
			Preamble
			</p>
			<p>
			Software is more than a mere economic asset. It 
			is the technical foundation of the information 
			society. Therefore, the issue of the public share 
			in software is of particular importance. 
			Conventionally licensed computer programs are 
			distributed in object code form only, and the 
			user is not entitled to modify or pass on the 
			program to third parties. The license model for 
			Free Software (synonym "Open Source Software"), 
			however, grants comprehensive rights in the 
			handling of the program. The German Free Software 
			License is based on this license model. It gives 
			you the right to use the program in a 
			comprehensive manner. You are allowed to modify 
			the computer program according to your 
			requirements or to reproduce or distribute it and 
			make it publicly available in a modified or 
			unmodified form. These rights are granted free of 
			charge. 
			</p>
			<p>
			However, the German Free Software License 
			combines these rights with certain obligations 
			that will ensure the free circulation of the 
			program and all further developments published. 
			If you distribute the program or make it publicly 
			available, you have to include a copy of this 
			license to anyone receiving the program from you 
			and enable access to its source code. Another 
			obligation arises from further developments of 
			the program. Modifications to the program which 
			you distribute or make publicly available shall 
			be released in accordance with the conditions of 
			this license. 
			</p>
			<p>
			German Free Software License takes into account 
			the special requirements of German and European 
			law. It is drafted bilingually and thus intended 
			for international distribution. 
			</p>
			<p>
			
			Section 0 Definitions
			</p>
			<p>

			downloaded by any Internet user without license 
			fee.
			</p>
			<p>
			
			Section 1 Rights
			</p>
			<p>
			(1) You may reproduce and distribute the Program 
			and make it publicly available in an unmodified 
			form. 
			</p>
			<p>
			(2) You may modify the Program and reproduce and 
			distribute modified versions and make them 
			publicly available. It is also permitted to 
			combine the Program or parts thereof with other 
			programs. 
			</p>
			<p>
			(3) You obtain the rights free of charge.
			</p>
			<p>
			
			Section 2 Obligations for Distribution and Making 
			Publicly Available
			</p>
			<p>
			(1) If you distribute the Program or make it 
			publicly available, be it in unmodified or 
			modified form, be it in combination with other 
			programs or in connection with hardware, you also 
			have to provide or include the following:
			</p>
			<p>
			1. all references to this License in the Source 
			Code and/or Object Code;
			 
			2. all references in the Source Code and/or 
			Object Code containing information about the 
			author of the Program;
			</p>
			<p>
			3. a conspicuous reference to this License and 
			the Internet address <http://www.d-fsl.org>, to 
			be displayed in a form that can easily be read by 
			the recipient;
			</p>
			<p>
			4. the complete text of this License in a form 
			easy to perceive.
			</p>
			<p>
			(2) If license and/or contract terms are 
			displayed when the Program is installed and/or 
			started, the following items must also be 
			displayed:
			</p>
			<p>
			1. this License;
			</p>
			<p>
			2. a reference to this License; and
			</p>
			<p>
			3. a reference to the Entitled Person(s) to the 
			initial program components used under this 
			License.
			</p>
			<p>
			(3) You may not make the use of the Program 
			contingent upon the compliance with conditions or 
			obligations that are not set forth in this 
			License. 
			</p>
			<p>
			(4) Provided that you have received Documentation 
			for the Program, you have to deliver this 
			Documentation with the Program, as well, unless 
			free delivery of the Documentation is not 
			permitted by the documentation license.
			</p>
			<p>
			
			Section 3 Further Obligations regarding the 
			Distribution of Modified Versions 
			</p>
			<p>
			(1) You may only distribute modified versions of 
			the Program or make them publicly available in 
			accordance with the terms of this License, so 
			that any third party is able to make use of the 
			modified Program as a whole under this License. 
			</p>
			<p>
			(2) If the Program or a part thereof is combined 
			with another program, this also applies to the 
			entire combination as a modified version of the 
			Program, unless the other program is independent 
			in terms of form and content.  Another program 
			shall be regarded as independent if it fulfils 
			the following requirements:
			</p>
			<p>
			1. The Source Code of the combined programs must 
			be contained in separate files which do not 
			include components of the other part except for 
			parts containing the information customary and 
			required for the Program combination. The Source 
			Code of the other program does not have to be 
			delivered.
			</p>
			<p>
			2. The part which is combined with the Program 
			must also be reasonably usable when not combined 
			with the Program, i.e. on a standalone basis or 
			with other programs. The meaning of "reasonably 
			usable" will be based on the opinion of pertinent 
			circles of expert groups in the relevant field. 
			Such circles of experts include everyone who 
			develops, uses, distributes or makes publicly 
			available the Program concerned or programs with 
			similar functionality.
			</p>
			<p>
			(3) If you distribute or make publicly available 
			the Program or parts thereof - modified or 
			unmodified - in combination with another program 
			licensed under the GNU General Public License 
			(GPL), the Program may also be used under 
			conditions of the GPL, provided it constitutes a 
			"derivative work" together with the other program 
			in the sense of the GPL. In this case, any 
			reference to this License should be removed and 
			replaced by a reference to the GPL. Whether a 
			"derivative work" in the sense of the GPL arises 
			from this combination is primarily defined in 
			section 2 b) of the GPL. This provision reads: 
			"You must cause any work that you distribute or 
			publish, that in whole or in part contains or is 
			derived from the Program or any part thereof, to 
			be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third 
			parties under the terms of this License." The GPL 
			can be obtained under 
			<http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl>.
			</p>
			<p>
			(4) If you distribute the Program or make it 
			publicly available in a modified form, you must 
			include a reference to the modifications and the 
			date of the modification in the Source Code. This 
			reference must reveal which modifications were 
			carried out and include existing references 
			containing information on the author of the 
			Program. This applies to whether or not you add 
			your own copyright notice. Instead of a reference 
			in the Source Code you may also use or carry on a 
			version control system, provided this is also 
			distributed or made publicly available. 
			</p>
			<p>
			(5) You may not charge any third party for the 
			granting of the non-exclusive rights of use for 
			the Program.
			</p>
			<p>
			(6) If you acquire any other intellectual or 
			industrial property right to this Program apart 
			from a copyright, in particular a patent or 
			utility model, you license this intellectual or 
			industrial property right for modified or 
			unmodified versions of the Program to the extent 
			that is necessary to make due use of the rights 
			arising from this License. 
			</p>
			<p>
			
			Section 4 Further Obligations for the 
			Distribution of the Object Code
			</p>
			<p>
			(1) If you distribute the Program in Object Code 
			form only, apart from the obligations defined in 
			Sections 2 and 3, you have to either:
			</p>
			<p>
			1. make the Complete Source Code publicly 
			available in the Internet and - when distributing 
			the Object Code - make a clear reference to the 
			complete Internet address from which the Source 
			Code can be downloaded; or
			</p>
			<p>
			2.  distribute the Complete Source Code on a 
			customary data carrier, taking into consideration 
			Sections 2 and 3.
			</p>
			<p>
			(2) If you make the Program publicly available in 
			Object Code form, apart from the obligations 
			defined in Sections 2 and 3 you must also make 
			the Complete Source Code publicly available in 
			the Internet and make a clear reference to the 
			complete Internet address.
			</p>
			<p>
			(3) Provided that you have received the 
			Documentation for the Program, you have to 
			deliver this Documentation together with the 
			Program in accordance with Subsections 1 and 2, 
			as well, unless free delivery of the 
			Documentation is not permitted by the 
			documentation license.
			</p>
			<p>
			
			Section 5 Conclusion of the Contract
			</p>
			<p>
			(1) With this License you and any other person 
			are offered the conclusion of a contract for the 
			use of this Program under the conditions of this 
			License.
			</p>
			<p>
			(2) You may use the Program in accordance with 
			the applicable statutory provisions for the 
			intended purpose without having to accept this 
			License. In the European Union and in most other 
			legal systems, this right in particular includes 
			the following authorizations: 
			</p>
			<p>
			1. Running of the Program as well as reproducing 
			on hard-drive and RAM  required for this;
			</p>
			<p>
			2. Making of a back-up copy;
			</p>
			<p>
			3. Correcting errors;
			</p>
			<p>
			4. Distributing a lawfully acquired physical copy 
			of the Program.
			 
			(3) You declare your acceptance of this License 
			by distributing the Program, making it publicly 
			available, modifying or reproducing it in a way 
			that goes beyond the intended use in the sense of 
			Subsection 2. From this time on, this License 
			shall be deemed as a legally binding agreement 
			between the Entitled Persons and you, without the 
			need for the Entitled Persons to obtain a 
			declaration of acceptance.
			</p>
			<p>
			(4) You and any other licensee acquire the rights 
			arising from this License directly from the 
			Entitled Persons. Any sub-licensing or transfer 
			of rights is not permitted.
			 
			</p>
			<p>
			Section 6 Termination of Rights in the Event of 
			Violations
			</p>
			<p>
			(1) Any violation of your obligations under this 
			License automatically leads to the termination of 
			your rights under this License. 
			</p>
			<p>
			(2) Any rights of third parties having obtained 
			the Program or rights to the Program from you 
			shall remain unaffected. 
			</p>
			<p>
			
			Section 7 Liability and Warranty
			</p>
			<p>
			(1) The Entitled Persons are only liable for 
			conflicting third-party rights if they were aware 
			of such rights without informing you.
			</p>
			<p>
			(2) Liability for errors and/or other defects in 
			the Program shall be governed by agreements 
			concluded between you and the Entitled Person 
			beyond the scope of this License or, if no such 
			agreement exists, by the pertinent statutory 
			provisions.  
			</p>
			<p>
			
			Section 8 Agreements with Third Parties
			</p>
			<p>
			(1) This License only governs the relationship 
			between you and the Entitled Persons. It is not 
			part of agreements between you and third parties. 
			</p>
			<p>
			(2) This License does not limit your freedom to 
			conclude agreements of any content whatsoever 
			with third parties obtaining copies of the 
			Program from you or purchasing services from you 
			in connection with the Program, provided that you 
			fulfil your obligations under this License and 
			third-party rights under this License are not 
			infringed. In particular, you may charge a fee as 
			consideration for the transfer of the Program or 
			other services.  
			</p>
			<p>
			(3) This License does not commit you to forward 
			the Program to a third party. You are free to 
			decide to whom you wish to make the Program 
			available. However, you may not prevent or 
			complicate further use by third parties through 
			the use of technical protective measures, in 
			particular, the use of copy protection of any 
			kind. Password-protected access restriction or 
			use in an Intranet shall not be regarded as 
			technical protective measures.
			</p>
			<p>
			
			Section 9 Text of the License
			</p>
			<p>
			(1) This License is written in German and 
			English. Both versions are equally binding. It is 
			assumed that terminology used in the License has 
			the same meaning in both versions. Should, 
			however, differences arise, such meaning is 
			authoritative which best brings into line both 
			versions, taking into consideration the aim and 
			purpose of the License. 
			</p>
			<p>
			(2) The license board of the German Free Software 
			License may put into force binding new versions 
			of this License inasmuch as this is required and 
			reasonable. New versions of the License will be 
			published on the Internet site <http://www.d-
			fsl.org> with a unique version number. The new 
			version of the License becomes binding for you as 
			soon as you become aware of its publication. 
			Legal remedies against the modification of the 
			License are not restricted by the regulations 
			described above. 
			</p>
			<p>
			(3) You may reproduce and distribute this License 
			and make it publicly available in an unmodified 
			form. 
			</p>
			<p>
			
			Section 10 Applicable Law
			</p>
			<p>
			The License is governed by German law.
			</p>
			<p>
			
			Appendix: How to submit a Program to the German 
			Free Software License.
