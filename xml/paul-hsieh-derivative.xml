			Paul Hsieh derivative license
			</p>
			<p>
			The derivative content includes raw computer source code, ideas, opinions, and
			excerpts whose original source is covered under another license and
			transformations of such derivatives. Note that mere excerpts by themselves (with
			the exception of raw source code) are not considered derivative works under this
			license. Use and redistribution is limited to the following conditions:
			</p>
			<p>
			    One may not create a derivative work which, in any way, violates the Paul
			    Hsieh exposition license described above on the original content.
			</p>
			<p>
			    One may not apply a license to a derivative work that precludes anyone else
			    from using and redistributing derivative content.
			</p>
			<p>
			    One may not attribute any derivative content to authors not involved in the
			    creation of the content, though an attribution to the author is not
			    necessary.
