			EXCEPTION TO THE APACHE 2.0 LICENSE
			</p>
			<p>
			As a special exception to the Apache License 2.0 (and referring to the
			definitions in Section 1 of this license), you may link, statically or
			dynamically, the "Work" to other modules to produce an executable file
			containing portions of the "Work", and distribute that executable file
			in "Object" form under the terms of your choice, without any of the
			additional requirements listed in Section 4 of the Apache License 2.0.
			This exception applies only to redistributions in "Object" form (not
			"Source" form) and only if no modifications have been made to the "Work".
