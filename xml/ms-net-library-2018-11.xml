			MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS
			</p>
			<p>
			MICROSOFT .NET LIBRARY
			</p>
			<p>
			These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation
			(or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) and you.
			They apply to the software named above.
			The terms also apply to any Microsoft services or updates for the
			software, except to the extent those have different terms.
			</p>
			<p>
			If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below.
			</p>
			<p>
			1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.
			</p>
			<p>
			You may install and use any number of copies of the software to design, develop
			and test you're applications. You may modify, copy, distribute or deploy any .js
			files contained in the software as part of your applications.
			</p>
			<p>
			2. THIRD PARTY COMPONENTS. The software may include third party components with
			separate legal notices or governed by other agreements, as may be described in
			the ThirdPartyNotices file(s) accompanying the software.
			</p>
			<p>
			3. ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.
			</p>
			<p>
			a. DISTRIBUTABLE CODE. In addition to the .js files described above, the
			software is comprised of Distributable Code. “Distributable Code” is code that
			you are permitted to distribute in programs you develop if you comply with the
			terms below.
			</p>
			<p>
			i. Right to Use and Distribute.
			</p>
			<p>
			. You may copy and distribute the object code form of the software.

			. Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your programs to copy
			and distribute the Distributable Code as part of those programs.
			</p>
			<p>
			ii. Distribution Requirements. For any Distributable Code you distribute, you
			must
			</p>
			<p>
			. use the Distributable Code in your programs and not as a standalone
			distribution;
			</p>
			<p>
			. require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that protect it
			at least as much as this agreement;
			</p>
			<p>
			. display your valid copyright notice on your programs; and
			</p>
			<p>
			. indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims, including
			attorneys' fees, related to the distribution or use of your applications, except
			to the extent that any claim is based solely on the Distributable Code.
			</p>
			<p>
			iii. Distribution Restrictions. You may not
			</p>
			<p>
			. alter any copyright, trademark or patent notice in the Distributable Code;
			</p>

			</p>
			<p>
			. others have the right to modify it.
			</p>
			<p>
			4. DATA.
			</p>
			<p>
			a. Data Collection. The software may collect information about you and your use
			of the software, and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information
			to provide services and improve our products and services. You may opt-out of
			many of these scenarios, but not all, as described in the product documentation.
			There are also some features in the software that may enable you and Microsoft
			to collect data from users of your applications. If you use these features, you
			must comply with applicable law, including providing appropriate notices to
			users of your applications together with a copy of Microsoft's privacy
			statement. Our privacy statement is located at
			https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704. You can learn more about data
			collection and use in the help documentation and our privacy statement. Your use
			of the software operates as your consent to these practices.
			</p>
			<p>
			b. Processing of Personal Data. To the extent Microsoft is a processor or
			subprocessor of personal data in connection with the software, Microsoft makes
			the commitments in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation Terms
			of the Online Services Terms to all customers effective May 25, 2018, at
			http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9840733.
			</p>
			<p>
			5. Scope of License. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only
			gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights.
			Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use
			the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you
			must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you
			to use it in certain ways. You may not
			</p>
			<p>
			. work around any technical limitations in the software;
			</p>
			<p>

			<p>
			. remove, minimize, block or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in
			the software;

			export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include
			restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further information on
			export restrictions, visit www.microsoft.com/exporting.
			</p>
			<p>
			7. SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is “as is,” we may not provide
			support services for it.
			</p>
			<p>
			8. Entire Agreement. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates,
			Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire
			agreement for the software and support services.
			</p>
			<p>
			9. Applicable Law. If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington
			law applies to interpretation of and claims for breach of this agreement, and
			the laws of the state where you live apply to all other claims. If you acquired
			the software in any other country, its laws apply.
			</p>
			<p>
			10. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal
			rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of
			your state or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft,
			you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the
			software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your
			state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the
			software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the
			following provisions apply to you:
			</p>
			<p>
			a) Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law
			and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.
			</p>
			<p>
			b) Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving
			updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device
			from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet, however, the
			software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the
			software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off
			updates for your specific device or software.
			</p>
			<p>
			c) Germany and Austria.
			</p>
			<p>
			(i) Warranty. The software will perform substantially as described in any
			Microsoft materials that accompany it. However, Microsoft gives no contractual
			guarantee in relation to the software.
			</p>
			<p>
			(ii) Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence,
			claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as in case of death or
			personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.
			</p>
			<p>
			Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be liable for slight
			negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations,
			the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the
			breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance
			with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations").
			In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight
			negligence
			</p>
			<p>
			11. Disclaimer of Warranty. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK
			OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. TO
			THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED
			WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-
			INFRINGEMENT.
			</p>
			<p>
			12. Limitation on and Exclusion of Remedies and Damages. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM
			MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT
			RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL,
			INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
			</p>
			<p>
			This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services,
			content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party
			applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty,
			guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the
			extent permitted by applicable law.
			</p>
			<p>
			It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the
			possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to
			you because your state or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of
			incidental, consequential or other damages.
			</p>
			<p>

			clauses in this agreement are provided below in French.
			</p>

			dans ce contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en français.
			</p>
			<p>
			EXONÉRATION DE GARANTIE. Le logiciel visé par une licence est offert « tel quel
			». Toute utilisation de ce logiciel est à votre seule risque et péril. Microsoft

			additionnels en vertu du droit local sur la protection des consommateurs, que ce
			contrat ne peut modifier. La ou elles sont permises par le droit locale, les
			garanties implicites de qualité marchande, d'adéquation à un usage particulier

			LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS ET EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ POUR LES
			DOMMAGES. Vous pouvez obtenir de Microsoft et de ses fournisseurs une
			indemnisation en cas de dommages directs uniquement à hauteur de 5,00 $ US. Vous

			de responsabilité stricte, de négligence ou d'une autre faute dans la limite
			autorisée par la loi en vigueur.
			</p>
			<p>
			Elle s'applique également, même si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait connaître
			l'éventualité d'un tel dommage. Si votre pays n'autorise pas l'exclusion ou la
			limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou de
			quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l'exclusion ci-
			dessus ne s'appliquera pas à votre égard.
			</p>
			<p>
			EFFET JURIDIQUE. Le présent contrat décrit certains droits juridiques. Vous
			pourriez avoir d'autres droits prévus par les lois de votre pays. Le présent
			contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois de votre pays si
			celles-ci ne le permettent pas.
