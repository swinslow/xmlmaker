			The fonts contained in this archive are Freeware. No payment is required for the use of these fonts.  They're free!
			Commercial use?  Sure, but a donation or a product sample would be appreciated.
			</p>
			<p>
			$40 US is the usual donation amount per font for commercial use but any amount is appreciated.
			</p>
			<p>
			I make all the fonts (over 400 of them) on my web page and they're all free. I offer Deluxe versions of some of my
			fonts for sale.  They contain several weights and styles of each font.  Just click on "DELUXE FONTS" at
			Larabie Fonts to see them.

			I've provided the world with over 400 free fonts, so if you'd like to make a donation I'd be more than happy to accept it.
			No donation is too small.

			double check the address have a look at the donation section on any of my webpages.  If you'd like to use a credit card
			to send a donation drop by my site and click on the DONATIONS section.

			Here's an unofficial, non-legalese summary of the following contract:
			You can use the font for commercial or non-commercial purposes. You can make things with the font, just don't change
			the font itself or use it to make new fonts. You can give the font away as long as it hasn't been altered and this text file
			remains with the font.  Don't remove or alter the copyright notice on the font.  Don't convert the fonts if the conversion
			program alters the copyright notice.  If my font makes your hair fall out - thats' too damn bad!
