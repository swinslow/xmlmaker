			OSGi Specification License, Version 2.0.
			</p>
			<p>
			License Grant
			</p>
			<p>
			OSGi Alliance ("OSGi") hereby grants you a fully-paid, non-exclusive, non-
			transferable, worldwide, limited license (without the right to sublicense),
			under OSGiâ€™s applicable intellectual property rights to view, download, and
			reproduce this OSGi Specification ("Specification") which follows this License
			Agreement ("Agreement"). You are not authorized to create any derivative work of
			the Specification. However, to the extent that an implementation of the
			Specification would necessarily be a derivative work of the Specification, OSGi
			also grants you a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty
			free, limited license (without the right to sublicense) under any applicable
			copyrights, to create and/or distribute an implementation of the Specification
			that: (i) fully implements the Specification including all its required
			interfaces and functionality; (ii) does not modify, subset, superset or
			otherwise extend the OSGi Name Space, or include any public or protected
			packages, classes, Java interfaces, fields or methods within the OSGi Name Space
			other than those required and authorized by the Specification. An implementation
			that does not satisfy limitations (i)-(ii) is not considered an implementation
			of the Specification, does not receive the benefits of this license, and must
			not be described as an implementation of the Specification. An implementation of
			the Specification must not claim to be a compliant implementation of the
			Specification unless it passes the OSGi Compliance Tests for the Specification
			in accordance with OSGi processes. "OSGi Name Space" shall mean the public class
			or interface declarations whose names begin with "org.osgi" or any recognized
			successors or replacements thereof.
			</p>
			<p>
			OSGi Participants (as such term is defined in the OSGi Intellectual Property
			Rights Policy) have made non-assert and licensing commitments regarding patent
			claims necessary to implement the Specification, if any, under the OSGi
			Intellectual Property Rights Policy which is available for examination on the
			OSGi public web site (www.osgi.org).
			</p>
			<p>
			No Warranties and Limitation of Liability
			</p>
			<p>
			THE SPECIFICATION IS PROVIDED "AS IS," AND OSGi AND ANY OTHER AUTHORS MAKE NO
			REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
			TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-
			INFRINGEMENT, OR TITLE; THAT THE CONTENTS OF THE SPECIFICATION ARE SUITABLE FOR
			ANY PURPOSE; NOR THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SUCH CONTENTS WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY
			THIRD PARTY PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS OR OTHER RIGHTS. OSGi AND ANY OTHER
			AUTHORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
			CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF ANY USE OF THE SPECIFICATION OR THE
			PERFORMANCE OR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONTENTS THEREOF.
			</p>
			<p>
			Covenant Not to Assert
			</p>
			<p>
			As a material condition to this license you hereby agree, to the extent that you
			have any patent claims which are necessarily infringed by an implementation of
			the Specification, not to assert any such patent claims against the creation,
			distribution or use of an implementation of the Specification.
			</p>
			<p>
			General
			</p>
			<p>
			The name and trademarks of OSGi or any other Authors may NOT be used in any
			manner, including advertising or publicity pertaining to the Specification or
			its contents without specific, written prior permission. Title to copyright in
			the Specification will at all times remain with OSGi.
			</p>
			<p>
			No other rights are granted by implication, estoppel or otherwise.
