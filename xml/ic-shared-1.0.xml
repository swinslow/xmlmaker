			<p>
			3. Conditions and Limitations
			</p>
			<p>
			   (A) Platform Limitation - The licenses granted in sections 2(A) and 2(B)

			   may do so only under this license by including a complete copy of this
			   license with your distribution. If you distribute any portion of the software
			   in compiled or object code form, you may only do so under a license that

			</p>
			<p>
			   (E) If you have modified the Software or created derivative works, and
			   distribute such modifications or derivative works, you will cause the
			   modified files to carry prominent notices so that recipients know that they

			   with less restrictions on how the contribution can be reproduced, modified
			   and distributed than this license. A more permissive license may be in

			   in section 3 (A) of this license. A more permissive license shall include in
			   particular the Apache License Version 2.0 (or future versions thereof) and
			   the MIT License. The decision on such a distribution under a more permissive
			   license is at the sole discretion of the Foundation.
